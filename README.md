By harnessing the power of computer vision, we can transform the way soccer can be understood, watched, and even played. This project uses pre-trained Computer Vision models to analyze every moment of a match—tracking players, speeds, ball control, and more—to provide deep, actionable stats. Although no past ML experience is required, members should be very comfortable with Python as the overall goal of the project will be to build a Python package for soccer match analysis.

## Key Features

### 1. Camera Calibration and Pitch Localization
We utilize key stationary points on the soccer pitch to perform accurate camera calibration. This ensures that every frame moevement is properly accounted for, which is essential for precise tracking and analysis throughout the game. Our system uses these key points to localize the pitch in the video. we compute a homography to accurately map 2D video data to 3D pitch space. This enables highly accurate spatial analysis of player and ball positions, movements, and interactions. This process ensures that all measurements, such as player positions and movements, are grounded in real-world field locations, making our data actionable and accurate.

### 2. Team Assignments
Players are automatically assigned to teams based on their position and movement on the field. This allows us to derive team-based statistics, formations, and strategies.

### 3. Player Speed and Distance Traveled
By tracking players over time, we can calculate their speed and total distance traveled during a match. This data provides insights into player stamina, effort, and performance.

## How It Works
The system works by combining computer vision models with traditional field recognition techniques. The workflow includes:
- **Player Detection**: Using pre-trained models to detect players, referees, and the ball in video frames.
- **Field Detection**: Using pre-trained Roboflow models to detect multiple relevant field areas.
- **Object Tracking**: Tracking detected objects across frames to generate consistent data for each player.
- **Homography Computation**: Mapping the video frames onto a real-world soccer pitch using detected key points for accurate spatial measurements.

## Future Enhancements
We are continually working to improve and expand the capabilities of this project, with the following planned features:
- Enhanced player detection and tracking accuracy.
- Additional metrics, including pass success rates, shot accuracy and ball control.
- Real-time analysis for live matches.
